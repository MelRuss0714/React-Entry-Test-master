*CSS*

    For the CSS portion, getting the basics is the most important which will be listed below, however if you consider yourself a web designer and want to do more than the list, please do. 
    1. Style the buttons to any extent you want to
    2. Add an image to the background that still allows you to read everything. 
    3. If the number in the header is greater than or equal to 50, then the number header needs to be a red. If the number is below 50, then the number header needs to be a blue.
